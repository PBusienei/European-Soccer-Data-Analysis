# European-Soccer-Data-Analysis

This project, I will be using an open dataset from the popular site Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer. This European Soccer Database has more than 25,000 matches and more than 10,000 players for European professional soccer seasons from 2008 to 2016.

The dataset has attributes on weekly game updates, team line up, and detailed match events.


# Goal

The goal of this project is to walk through the Data Analytics process and analyze the dataset. The process will include some steps for exploring and cleaning the dataset, some steps for predicting player performance using basic statistics, and some steps for grouping similar clusters using machine learning KMeans Clustering.
